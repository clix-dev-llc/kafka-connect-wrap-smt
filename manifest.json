  "description": "<p>Kafka Connect single message transform (SMT) wrapping key and record of kafka messages into a single struct. This ensures, e.g., that data contained in complex keys is not lost when ingesting data from kafka in a sink such as elasticsearch. Additionally, it supports exporting meta-data including partition, offset, timestamp, topic name and kafka headers.</p><p>Note that this transform does only support <b>sink connectors</b>, as it wraps kafka specific meta-data that is not available for all source connectors.</p>",
